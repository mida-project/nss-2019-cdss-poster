This repository comes with the set of important information for the poster presented at the [National Science Summit 2019 (NSS'2019)](http://www.encontrociencia.pt/2019) event. This poster *template* is based on our early results of the "**[Medical Imaging Diagnosis Assistant: AI-Assisted Radiomics Framework User Validation](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/333324558_Medical_Imaging_Diagnosis_Assistant_AI-Assisted_Radiomics_Framework_User_Validation)**" poster. This time, we present a novel [Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC130063/) across the breast cancer diagnosis. The work is published on the [NSS'2019](http://www.encontrociencia.pt/2019) event. The [NSS'2019](http://www.encontrociencia.pt/2019) is a [Portuguese](https://www.portugal.gov.pt) event that aims at promoting a broad debate on the main topics and challenges of the scientific agenda beyond the world of research. The meeting main goal, therefore, is to stimulate not just the participation but also the interaction between researchers, the business sector and the general public. The general template can be found on the [`src/`](src/) directory. We used the [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) format, a typesetting system that includes features designed for the production of technical and scientific documentation. [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) is available as [free software](https://www.latex-project.org/lppl/).
